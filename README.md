# Personal Memoirs of a Project

Our team started the project with the fewest number of people in Class A, but finished the project the fastest.

<br/>
<br/>

It was my first web development, but I successfully implemented the functions except bookmark.

It worked fine on Windows but not on Mac due to an error.

If I learn more, I definitely want to solve this problem.

<br/>
<br/>

What I've discovered while working with Jinja2 myself so far is that the error occurs in comments in body.

I will try to code pages using Jinja2 and JWT later when I have time.
